# to-do-app-django
It is a to-do app made using django
Hello, this is my first django app, it is to-do list application
This project was mostly based on the video of Dennis Ivy (link to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llbtoQTt4qw)

The stylization of the project is not perfect, but I mostly focused on backend (django)

I personally added some changes to the tutorial, adding information about tasks, because in the original video Dennis did not add task description and date of task


So far so good, I will be working on new projects soon, hope to gain more experience and get better with django, it was interesting and fun experience to code along with professionals, but I want more and make apps myself
